# Electric Piano

## Overview
This is a simple electric piano, based around a 555 and 386. It uses a series of resistors to generate the sound output.

The music can be played over the onboard speaker, or captured through the 3.5mm audio port. 

This design is a modernization of [drj113's Stylophone design](https://www.instructables.com/A-Stylophone/)
